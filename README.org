* Applied Statistics

This repo contains the coursework and projects that were done over the course of my M.S. in Applied Statistics.

This is meant to be a portfolio of my progress as a Statistician and provide a
nice way to let others view my results, code, and datasets that I have worked
on.

** Courses
- /Probability & Statistics Series 1-3 (Not Shown)/
- Applied Statistics Series 1-3
- Applied Regression Analysis
- Time Series Analysis
- Design of Experiments

** References

  While I do have notes from Probability and Statistics 1-3, this cookbook does
  an excellent job summarizing the content so in lieu of the laborious effort of
  copying my notes into here, this will do instead.
