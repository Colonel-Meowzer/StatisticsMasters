This is a place where miscellaneous notes for the Optimization course are kept.
These mostly include notes that were taken prior to the start of the course as
an independent study in an effort to get familiar with *Convex Optimization*.

* High Level Overview (Convex Optimization)

** Optimization

A class of problems where an Objective is to be optimized based on a series of
Constraints.

Minimize $f_0(x)$
With constraints $f_i(x) \leq b_i$

For a consistent framework, even if the optimization problem requires the
/maximum/ value, this can still be accomplished by minimizing the negative.
