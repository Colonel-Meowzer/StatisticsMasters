> Refer to the dataset ConcussionsByTeamAndYear.csv found under the Week Six course content of D2L. Let $Y_i$ be the number of concussions from team $i = 1, ..., 32$. The model is $Y_i | \lambda_i \sim Poisson(\lambda_i)$ and the prior is $\lambda_i | \theta \sim Gamma(1, \theta)$ where $\theta \sim Gamma(0.1, 0.1)$.

# 1

> Derive the full conditional distribution of $\lambda_1$.

# 2

> Derive the full conditional distribution of $\theta$.

# 3

> Write Gibbs sampling code to draw samples from the joint distribution of $(\lambda_1, ..., \lambda_{32}, \theta)$.

# 4

> Show trace plots of the samples for $\lambda_1$ and $\theta$. (These plots of the value of the parameter on the y-axis and the iteration number on the x-axis).

# 5

> Plot the estimated posterior mean of $\lambda_i$ versus $Y_i$ and comment on whether the code is returning reasonable estimates
