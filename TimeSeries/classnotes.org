* Chapter 1 - Characteristics of Time Series
** Definitions
*Filtered Series*: A linear combination of values in a time series

*Autoregression*: A time series where the current value $x_t$ is dependent on a
function of previous values $x_{t - 1}, x_{t - 2}$, ..., etc. The order of
Autoregression is dependent on the number of previous values.

*Random Walk (with Drift)*: An AR(1) model with some constant $\delta$ called /drift/. When
$\delta = 0$, this is called a Random Walk.
$x_t = \delta + x_{t - 1} + w_t$

*Signal-to-noise Ratio (SNR)*: $SNR = \frac{A}{\sigma_w}$
$A$: Amplitude of the Waveform
$\sigma_w$: Additive noise term

Note: A sinusoidal wave form can be written as $A cos(2 \pi \omega t + \phi)$
